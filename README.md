FoodTruckin'
===========

Find food trucks around San Francisco!


Improvements
===========

What I would do if I had more time to work on this:
- error messaging on not-found location/food-type inputs
- strong location constraint to SF area
- flag colors or cool icons based on food type (also better truck categorization)
- info on open hours for trucks
- visual improvements: making the UI wasy classier, as well as sizing the map more intelligently to fit different browser windows


Technical Decisions
===========

I chose to use Flask for this even though all my previous (rather limited) web dev experience was with Node.js, because I like Python a lot as a scripting language and had heard good things about the Flask framework. I also had very little previous experience with any Google maps APIs, but this seemed like a good way to go because they have so much functionality and data behind them.
